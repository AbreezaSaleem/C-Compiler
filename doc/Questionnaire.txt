Structures) or CSCI E-124 (Data Structures and Algorithms), how do you
meet the prerequisite?
- N/A

More specifically, do you have experience implementing many different
data structures from scratch?  If yes, please describe.  If not, how
do you meet the prerequisite?
- Yes. Implemented all common data structures from scratch in CS-202 including BST, LinkedList etc

Posix/Linux/Unix shell commands?  Do you have experience programming
using Posix/Linux/Unix system calls?  If yes, please describe.
- Yes. I've worked with Linux commands during my time at university and at my jobs.

Do you have experience using Windows?  If so, as a user or as a
programmer?
- Yes, as a programmer.

What additional appropriate course or work experience do you have?
- I studied the concepts we discuss in class in the following courses

What is your math background?
- Took all the required Math courses in my Bachelor's.

What computer languages do you know (please include assembler and
high-level languages)?  Have you programmed in the C Programming
Language, C++, or Java?
- I am pretty comfortable with the following:
